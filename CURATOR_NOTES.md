The Bauhaus:

The Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, revolutionized design by merging art, craft, and technology for mass production. Emphasizing “form follows function,” it promoted functionalism, minimalism, and geometry in architecture, furniture, and typography. Relocating to Dessau in 1925, it built iconic glass-curtain-wall structures before Nazi pressure closed it in 1933, scattering masters like Mies van der Rohe worldwide. Its legacy shaped modernism and the International Style.

Not to be confused with Arts and Crafts because Bauhaus embraced industrial machines for affordable mass production, unlike the handmade, anti-industrial focus of Arts and Crafts.

Swiss Style/ International Typographic Style:

Swiss Style, or International Typographic Style, emerged in 1950s Switzerland from schools like Basel and Zurich, prioritizing objectivity through sans-serif type, grids, and asymmetry. Pioneers Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann used flush-left rags, white space, and photography for clear communication in posters and books. It spread globally via Helvetica font, influencing corporate identity and modernism into the 1970s. Rejecting ornament, it stressed “legibility above all.”

Not to be confused with Bauhaus because Swiss Style focused on strict typographic grids and sans-serifs for print in post-WWII Switzerland, while Bauhaus integrated broader crafts and architecture pre-1933.

Reaction to Swiss:

Grunge Typography emerged in the early 1990s as a punk-fueled backlash against Swiss Style’s rigid grids and pristine sans-serifs. Designers like David Carson layered distorted fonts, photocopy textures, and chaotic overlaps in Ray Gun magazine, embracing illegibility for raw emotion. Fueled by Seattle grunge music and desktop publishing, it favored distressed edges and handwritten scrawls through the late 1990s. This anti-corporate rebellion prioritized attitude over order, influencing zines and album art.

Not to be confused with Postmodernism because Grunge specifically rejected Swiss precision via gritty, music-driven distortion in the 1990s, while Postmodernism broadly played with historical quotes earlier.
